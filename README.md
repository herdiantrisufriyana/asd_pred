# Project template

## System requirements

Install Docker desktop once in your machine. Start the service every time you build this project image or run the container.

## Installation guide

Change `asd_pred` to the project image name.

Build the project image once for a new machine (currently support AMD64 and ARM64).

```{bash}
docker build -t asd_pred --load .
```

Run the container every time you start working on the project. Change left-side port numbers for either Rstudio or Jupyter lab if any of them is already used by other applications.

In terminal:

```{bash}
docker run -d -p 8787:8787 -p 8888:8888 -v "$(pwd)":/home/rstudio/project --name asd_pred_container asd_pred
```

In command prompt:

```{bash}
docker run -d -p 8787:8787 -p 8888:8888 -v "%cd%":/home/rstudio/project --name asd_pred_container asd_pred
```

## Instructions for use

### Rstudio

Change port number in the link, accordingly, if it is already used by other applications.
